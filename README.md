# Supply Chain Transparency DApp

## Project Title  
Supply Chain Transparency DApp

## Project Description  
This is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum (or any EVM-compatible chain) to improve transparency in supply chains. Stakeholders like manufacturers, distributors, and retailers can register and track products on-chain, providing an immutable history of product ownership and status.

## Project Vision  
Our vision is to make supply chains fully transparent, traceable, and trustworthy. By leveraging blockchain, we aim to eliminate data opacity, reduce fraud, and ensure all participants — from producers to end consumers — can verify a product’s journey in a secure, decentralized manner.

## Key Features  
- **Product Registration**: Admin (or manufacturer) can create new products on-chain.  
- **Ownership Transfer**: Products can be transferred securely from one stakeholder to another.  
- **Status Updates**: The lifecycle status of products (Created, In Transit, Delivered) can be updated transparently.  
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every transfer and status update is logged on-chain via events, ensuring an immutable history.

## Future Scope  
Here are some possible extensions / future improvements:  
- **Role-based Access Control**: Introduce roles such as Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, Consumer (e.g., using OpenZeppelin’s `AccessControl`).  
- **Batch Tracking**: Support for batches of products, rather than single product units.  
- **Payment Mechanism**: Add payment / escrow functionality, so transfers can involve payments.  
- **Off-chain Metadata**: Use IPFS or decentralized storage for richer product metadata (pictures, QR codes, certificates).  
- **Oracles Integration**: Integrate with oracles (e.g., Chainlink) for real-world data (temperature, GPS, etc.) during shipment.  
- **Frontend UI**: Build a user-facing web interface (React / Vue) to let stakeholders interact with the contract.  
- **Audit & Security**: Add security features (pausable, emergency stop) and perform audits using static analysis tools (e.g., Slither).
